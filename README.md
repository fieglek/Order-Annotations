# Order Annotations
Sketch Plugin to sort those pesky wireframe annotations.

A simple plugin to number annotations from top to bottom.

## Instructions for Annotation numbering:
1. Create a symbol named "Annotation" with a text field.
2. Use symbol to annotate design. Make sure to copy and paste annotations so all have differently named layers.
3. When ready to annotate, drag over the artboard to select all the layers. Alternatively, for faster processing, only select the annotation symbols. 
4. Hit Shift+Command+M, and then annotations will be numbered correctly.

## Instructions for sidebar numbering:
1. Create a text layer with the format: "1 - Lorem Ipsum".
2. Select all the layers that need to be numbered.
3. Hit Shift+Command+, and then annotations will be numbered correctly.

## Future Updates:
* Make it so Annotations can be named the same thing
* Auto-select all layers on active artboard instead of manually selecting layers
