# Order Annotations
Sketch Plugin to sort those pesky wireframe annotations.

A simple plugin to number annotations from top to bottom.

Instructions:
1. Create a symbol named "Annotation" with a text field.
2. Use symbol to annotate design. Make sure to copy and paste annotations so all have differently named layers.
3. When ready to annotate, drag over the artboard to select all the layers. 
4. Hit Shift+Command+M, and then annotations will be numbered correctly.

Future Updates:
* Make it so Annotations can be named the same thing
* Auto-select all layers on active artboard instead of manually selecting layers
